The goal of datazoom.amazonia is to facilitate access to official data
regarding the Amazon. The package provides functions that download and
pre-process selected datasets. The function below provides a brief
description of the available datasets:

``` r

The package is under development so the following functions still do not
support pre-processing and language arguments, returning only the raw
data:

``` r
load_seeg()
```

The Comex dataset gathers data extracted from Siscomex (Integrated
System of Foreign Trade), which is a database containing information
from all products that are imported to or exported from Brazil. Using
data reported from the companies which are responsible for the process
of transporting the products, the system adheres to internationally
standardized nomenclatures, such as the Harmonized System and the
Mercosul Common Nomenclature (which pertains to members of the Mercosul
organization).

The data has a monthly frequency and is available starting from the year
1989. From 1989 to 1996, a different system of nomenclatures was
adopted, but all conversions are available on a dictionary in the Comex
website
(<https://www.gov.br/produtividade-e-comercio-exterior/pt-br/assuntos/comercio-exterior/estatisticas/base-de-dados-bruta/>).

## 3.3) PAM:

Municipal Agricultural Production (PAM, in Portuguese) is a nationwide
annual survey conducted by IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and
Statistics) which provides information on agricultural products, such as
quantity produced, area planted and harvested, average quantity of
output and monetary value of such output. The products are divided in
permanent and temporary farmed land, as well as dedicated surveys to the
four products that yield multiple harvests a year (beans, potato, peanut
and corn), which all sum to a total survey of 64 agricultural products
(31 of temporary tillage and 33 of permanent tillage). Output, however,
is only included in the dataset if the planted area occupies over 1 acre
or if output exceeds one tonne.

    There are five parameters in this function:
      
      1. dataset: There are seven possible choices. 

      These datasets contain statistics such as quantity produced, area planted and harvested, average quantity of output and monetary value of such output.

      # 'pam_corn': it selects the data from the first and the second harvests of corn.
      # 'pam_potato': it selects the data from the first, the second and the third harvests of potato.
      # 'pam_peanut': it selects the data from the first and the second harvests of peanut.
      # 'pam_beans':  it selects the data from the first, the second and the third harvests of bean.

# 5) SEEG:

Loads data of estimates of emission of greenhouse gases of Brazilian
cities.

According to the SEEG Brasil website: all five sectors that are

    There are four parameters in this function:
      
      1. dataset: There are ssix choices:
      a. "seeg": provides all sectors in a same dataframe. Only works with raw_data = FALSE.
      b. "seeg farming": provides treated farming sector data
      c. "seeg_industry": provides treated industry sector data
      d. "seeg_energy": provides treated energy sector data
      e. "seeg_land": provides treated land sector data
      f. "seeg_residuals": provides treated residuals sector data
      
      2. raw_data: there are two options:
      # TRUE: if you want the raw data.
      # FALSE: if you want the processed version of the data. 
      
      3. geo_level: there are three options:
      # "country" 
      # "state"  
      # "municipality"
      
      4. language: you can choose between portuguese and english

``` r

data <- load_seeg(dataset = "seeg", 
                  raw_data = TRUE,
                  geo_level = "municipality")
  

# Download raw data (raw_data = TRUE) of greenhouse gases (dataset = "seeg") by state (geo_level = "state")
data <- load_seeg(dataset = "seeg", 
                  raw_data = TRUE,
                  geo_level = "state")
```

# 6) IBAMA:

Downloads and compiles data on environmental fines at the municipality
or state levels considering the Amazon region.

The function returns either the raw data or a data frame with aggregates
considering, for eachtime-location period, counts for total the number
of infractions, infractions that already went to trial, and number of
unique perpetrators of infractions.

    There are five parameters in this function:

      1. dataset = "areas_embargadas"

      3. geo_level: "municipality"
      
      4. language: you can choose between portuguese and english
      
      5. legal_amazon_only: setting the return of Legal Amazon Data (legal_amazon_only = TRUE) or Country´s Data (legal_amazon_only = FALSE)

``` r
# Download treated data (raw_data = FALSE) from the entire country 
# (legal_amazon_only = FALSE) in english (language = "eng")
data <- load_ibama(dataset = "areas_embargadas", raw_data = FALSE, 
                   language = "eng", legal_amazon_only = FALSE)

# Download raw data (raw_data = TRUE) from Legal Amazon region 
# (legal_amazon_only = TRUE)
data <- load_ibama(dataset = "areas_embargadas", raw_data = TRUE, 
                   legal_amazon_only = TRUE)
```

# 7) SIGMINE:

Loads information the mines being explored legally in Brazil, including
their location, status, product being mined and area in square meters
etc. Survey is done at municipal and state level. The National Mining
Agency (ANM) is responsible for this survey.

    There are three parameters in this function:
      
      1. dataset = 'sigmine_active'

      2. raw_data: there are two options:
      # TRUE: if you want the raw data.
      # FALSE: if you want the processed data. 

      3. language: you can choose between portuguese and english
      

``` r
# Download raw data (raw_data = TRUE).
data <- load_sigmine(dataset = 'sigmine_active', raw_data = TRUE)

# Download treated data (raw_data = FALSE) in portuguese (language = "pt").
data <- load_sigmine(dataset = 'sigmine_active', 
                     raw_data = TRUE,
                     language = "pt")
```

activity - Agriculture, Industry and Services - as well as taxes, net of
subsidies, GDP and GDP per capita.

    There are five parameters in this function:
